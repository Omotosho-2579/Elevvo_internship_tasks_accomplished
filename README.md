🎓 Student Score Prediction

This project was developed as part of an internship program.  
The goal is to **predict students' exam scores** based on study-related factors using machine learning techniques.

📌 Dataset
- Source: [Student Performance Factors Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- The dataset includes features such as:
  - Study hours
  - Sleep duration
  - Participation level
  - Previous scores  
  - Other lifestyle and academic factors

---

 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Normalized/standardized numerical data  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Visualized study hours vs exam scores  
   - Explored correlations between features and scores  

3. Model Training  
   - Linear Regression: Baseline model to predict exam scores  
   - Polynomial Regression (Bonus): Compared with linear regression for performance improvements  
   - Tested different feature combinations (study hours only vs. extended features like sleep, participation, etc.)  

4. Model Evaluation  
   - Metrics: R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
   - Visualized predictions vs actual scores

 📊 Results
- Linear Regression: Simple and interpretable baseline  
- Polynomial Regression: Improved accuracy but risk of overfitting  
- Feature engineering showed how lifestyle factors impact predictions beyond study hours

🚀 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
